# onenotefmt
Dash / Zeal docset builder for the Microsoft Onenote file format documentation.

Zeal is very useful for my way gof working and the Microsoft documentation web site is an extremely clunky mess.
I had an itch, so I'm scratching at it a little.

Contributions, comments and criticism are welcome and desired.
